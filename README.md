# Autohotkey-Scripts
This is an AHK (autohotkey) project made for automation of tasks that i am doing daily

I've started this project when the pandemic appeared. Mainly, the purpose of the project was to simplify my life as a highschooler, by doing:
- a mute/unmute microphone shortcut
- an automatic google forms presence completer
- an automatic classroom join system. i just press a button and then the program detects what class i have and it's joining the online class with the microphone muted.

But i extended the functionality for my daily tasks. For that, i connected alexa echo dot at my computer through TriggerCMD app, letting me run AHK scripts on my computer, directly from vocal commands (listed in the folder Amazon Modules):
- it opens the netflix link, it pauses the current video, opens the youtube watch later list and shuts down my computer

I have to mention that some scripts are made to work together with the remote configured with Arduino, listed on my git page as: [Arduino-Computer-Remote](https://github.com/MihaiMalos/Arduino-Computer-Remote)
